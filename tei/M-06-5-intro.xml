        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>On January 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>, 1594 Marenzio signed the dedication of his
        <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Sesto libro de madrigali a cinque voci </hi>to Cinzio Aldobrandini Passeri (1551&#x2013;1610), nephew of Pope
        Clement VIII and recently appointed cardinal. Aldobrandini was a distinguished patron of artists and poets, famously of Torquato Tasso;
        Battista Guarini, G. Bardi and Angelo Grillo, among others, were part of his patronage network.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p> See

        topoi and clich&#xE9;s, does not shed any further light on the circumstances of the composition and of the arrangement for publication. As is well
        known, after the death of his former patron Cardinal Luigi d&#x2019;Este in 1586, Marenzio had served Ferdinando de&#x2019; Medici in Rome and in Florence
        (1587&#x2013;1589 or 1590), then, back in Rome, had maintained multiple patronage connections, notably with Virginio Orsini (from 1589/90) and with
        Aldobrandini (probably from 1593).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p rend="footnote text"> For a recent and documented pr&#xE9;cis, see
            Paolo Fabbri, &#x201C;Marenzio, Luca&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani</hi>, vol. 70 (Rome: Istituto della Enciclopedia
            italiana, 2007; on line at <ref target="http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luca-marenzio_(Dizionario-Biografico)/">http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luca-marenzio_(Dizionario-Biografico)/</ref>, accessed August 25, 2014).</p></note> Meanwhile, his
        publication rhythm had considerably slowed down, compared to the years 1580 to 1587: the period 1588&#x2013;1593 had seen only the publication of the
        Book for 4, 5, and 6 voices (1588) and of Book V <hi rend="italic">a 6</hi> (1591). </p>
        <p>As if marking the end of this transitional phase or, rather, the beginning of a new chapter in Marenzio&#x2019;s career, Book VI
        <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">a 5 </hi>is characterized by a distinct change in the choice of texts, by a subtle montage, and by a
        noticeable stylistic shift. </p>
        <p>Of the seventeen texts set in the book, four (plus one adaptation, see below) are by Battista Guarini, three by G.B. Strozzi the Elder, one
        each by Ridolfo Arlotti (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1550&#x2013;1613), Livio Celiano, Antonio Ongaro (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1560&#x2013;1592/1599),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p rend="footnote text"> Interestingly, Ongaro had enjoined the patronage, among others, of Girolamo Ruiz,
            dedicatee of Marenzio&#x2019;s Book IV <hi rend="italic">a 5</hi> (1584). See Donatella Manzoli, &#x201C;Ongaro, Antonio&#x201D;, in <hi rend="italic">Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani</hi>, vol. 79 (Rome: Istituto della Enciclopedia italiana, 2013; on line at <ref target="http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-ongaro_(Dizionario-Biografico)/">http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/antonio-ongaro_(Dizionario-Biografico)/</ref>, accessed August 25, 2014). </p></note> and Torquato
        Tasso; one text each is furthermore attributed to Bonifazio Bevilacqua and Annibale Caro, while three texts remain anonymous (see Table
          1).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p rend="footnote text"> For more details about the attributions, see &#x201C;The poetic texts: edition
            and critical report&#x201D;. </p></note> Three aspects are remarkable: the absence of Petrarca and Sannazaro (which together accounted for
        fifteen texts out of twenty-one in Book I <hi rend="italic">a 4</hi> of 1585 and for eleven texts out of fifteen in the Book for 4, 5, and 6
        voices of 1588);<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p rend="footnote text"> They were, however, absent already from Book V <hi rend="italic">a 6</hi> of 1591.</p></note> the presence of Strozzi, which, in spite of previous settings by Marenzio,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p rend="footnote text"> In Book III <hi rend="italic">a 6</hi> (1585) and Book IV <hi rend="italic">a 6</hi> (1587).
          </p></note> is probably to refer to the appearance, in 1593, of a posthumous edition of his <hi rend="italic">Madrigali</hi>;<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p rend="footnote text"> All the three text set by Marenzio were included in that collection (see &#x201C;The
            poetic texts: edition and critical report&#x201D;), which, according to James Chater, &#x201C;momentarily revived&#x201D; interest in Strozzi&#x2019;s poetry among
            composers: see James Chater, &#x201C;Family Matters: Music in the Life and Poetry of Giovambattista Strozzi the Elder&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Perspectives on Luca Marenzio&#x2019;s Secular Music</hi>, ed. by Mauro Calcagno (Turnhout: Centre d&#x2019;&#xE9;tudes sup&#xE9;rieures de la
            Renaissance-Brepols, 2014), 75&#x2013;140: 93 and 105. Chater also suggests that Marenzio&#x2019;s Florentine connections, namely the families of Piero
            Strozzi and Gino Capponi, could help explain his &#x201C;easy access to Florentine poetry&#x201D; (104).</p></note> and the first occurrences of Livio
        Celiano (Angelo Grillo) and Antonio Ongaro, whose poems Marenzio will set again in the last books
        <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">a 5 </hi>of the late 1590s. </p>
        <p>The most innovative feature regards, however, Guarini: not so much for the presence and number of his texts (Marenzio had repeatedly set
        Guarini&#x2019;s poetry since his first madrigal book, Book I <hi rend="italic">a 5</hi> of 1580), as for their provenance from a work of crucial
        importance in late sixteenth-century culture, <hi rend="italic">Il pastor fido</hi>. While de Monte and Monteverdi published
        <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Pastor fido </hi>settings before Marenzio,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn8" n="8"><p rend="footnote text"> De Monte in his Book XIV <hi rend="italic">a 5</hi> (1590) and Monteverdi in his III <hi rend="italic">a 5</hi>
            (1592), one setting each: see James Chater, &#x201C;Fonti poetiche per i madrigali di Luca Marenzio,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Rivista italiana di
              musicologia</hi> 13, no. 1 (1978), 60&#x2013;103: 71&#x2013;72.</p></note> the latter was, in the words of Marco Bizzarini, &#x201C;the first of the leading
        madrigalists to set passages from Guarini&#x2019;s drama in more than a sporadic way&#x201D;.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9" n="9"><p rend="footnote text">
            Bizzarini, <hi rend="italic">Luca Marenzio</hi>, 257<hi rend="color(FF0000)">.</hi></p></note> The present book and the following one in
        the five-voice series (VII <hi rend="italic">a 5</hi>, 1595) &#x201C;have for <hi rend="italic">Il pastor fido</hi> a pioneering importance&#x201D;.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"><p rend="footnote text"> Ibid.</p></note> While the possibility of a direct contact between Marenzio and
        Guarini remains an undocumented speculation, and the circles of Aldobrandini and Cardinal Montalto might have played an instrumental
          role,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p rend="footnote text"> See again Bizzarini, <hi rend="italic">Luca Marenzio</hi>,
          293.</p></note> it has recently been suggested that Cardinal Scipione Gonzaga (1542&#x2013;1593) could have brought
        <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Il pastor fido </hi>to Marenzio&#x2019;s attention &#x201C;as a promising source of madrigal texts&#x201D;.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"><p rend="footnote text"> See Seth J. Coluzzi, &#x201C;&#x2018;Tirsi mio, caro Tirsi&#x2019;: <hi rend="italic">Il pastor
              fido</hi> and the Roman Madrigal, in <hi rend="italic">Perspectives on Luca Marenzio&#x2019;s Secular Music</hi>, 51&#x2013;74: 51&#x2013;53</p></note> Be it
        as it may, Marenzio&#x2019;s settings probably accompanied and fuelled the discussion about Guarini&#x2019;s controversial play in Cardinal Aldobrandini&#x2019;s
          <hi rend="italic">ridotto</hi> (and elsewhere, after the publication), and offered a sort of alternative realization of some passages, as if
        on the virtual, polyphonic stage of the madrigal.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"><p rend="footnote text"> See Coluzzi, &#x201C;&#x2018;Tirsi mio,
            caro Tirsi&#x2019;&#x201D;, 54&#x2013;55.</p></note>
      </p>
        <p>As many scholars have noticed,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"><p rend="footnote text"> See for instance Chater, &#x201C;Fonti poetiche per
            i madrigali di Luca Marenzio,&#x201D; 76&#x2013;77.</p></note> some of the names occurring in the texts set by Marenzio have been systematically
        altered. In no. 2, <hi rend="italic">Clori nel mio partire</hi>, no. 10, <hi rend="italic">Or chi, Clori beata</hi>, no. 12, <hi rend="italic">Clori mia, Clori dolce, oh sempre nuovo</hi>, and no. 15, <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Rimanti in pace&#x201D;, a la dolente e bella</hi>, the original
        &#x201C;Flora&#x201D;, &#x201C;Filli&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Fillida&#x201D; have been substituted by &#x201C;Clori&#x201D;/&#x201C;Cloride&#x201D;, while the first line in the <hi rend="italic">Pastor fido</hi>
        passage set as no. 11, <hi rend="italic">Deh, Tirsi, Tirsi, anima mia, perdona</hi>, originally sounded &#x201C;E tu, Mirtillo, anima mia,
          perdona&#x201D;.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"><p rend="footnote text"> For full details and literature, see the notes to the individual
            texts in &#x201C;The poetic texts: edition and critical report&#x201D;.</p></note> The two names also occur in nos. 6, <hi rend="italic">Still&#xF2; l&#x2019;anima
          in pianto</hi> (Tirsi and Clori), 16, <hi rend="italic">Ecco Maggio seren, chi l&#x2019;ha vestito</hi> (Clori, this time together with Filli), and
        17, <hi rend="italic">Cantiam la bella Clori</hi> (Clori only). Thus, Giuseppe Gerbino speaks of a &#x201C;subtle but unmistakable narrative thread&#x201D;
        that underlies the book: &#x201C;the story of Tirsi and Clori&#x201D;.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16"><p rend="footnote text"> Giuseppe Gerbino,
            &#x201C;Marenzio and the Shepherds of the Tiber Valley&#x201D;, in <hi rend="italic">Perspectives on Luca Marenzio&#x2019;s Secular Music</hi>, 265&#x2013;282:
            265.</p></note>
      </p>
        <p>Noticing that Tirsi was the pseudonym used by Virginio Orsini in his capacity as &#x201C;prince&#x201D; of the pastoral society known as &#x201C;pastori della
        valle tiberina&#x201D; (shepherds of the Tiber valley), James Chater has hypothesized that Tirsi and Clori should be identified as Virginio and his
        wife, Flavia Peretti.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17" n="17"><p rend="footnote text"> Chater, &#x201C;Fonti poetiche per i madrigali di Luca
            Marenzio,&#x201D; 77. In his recent and well-documented reassessment of the question, Giuseppe Gerbino has found &#x201C;no evidence either against or
            in support of Chater&#x2019;s hypothesis&#x201D;, and incidentally suggested that Clori could have been &#x201C;a singer connected with the Orsini family&#x201D;: see
            Gerbino, &#x201C;Marenzio and the Shepherds of the Tiber Valley&#x201D;, 266 and 277.</p></note> In this perspective, the final piece (no. 17, <hi rend="italic">Cantiam la bella Clori</hi>), whose epithalamic character has often been pointed out, should be interpreted as a nuptial
        homage to Flavia, whom Virginio had married in 1589. But besides the fact that Marenzio had already included a tribute to the pair in Book V
          <hi rend="italic">a 6</hi> in 1591,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18"><p rend="footnote text"> Dedicated to the same Virginio Orsini:
            see Paolo Cecchi, &#x201C;List of Secular and Devotional Compositions by Luca Marenzio&#x201D;, in <hi rend="italic">Perspectives on Luca Marenzio&#x2019;s
              Secular Music</hi>, 465&#x2013;522: 501&#x2013;502.</p></note> a new piece of information further complicates the matter. </p>
        <p>In 1595, just one year after the publication of our book, Marenzio dedicated his Book VI <hi rend="italic">a 6</hi> to Margherita Gonzaga
        (1564&#x2013;1618); the opening piece, <hi rend="italic">Lucida perla a cui fu conca il cielo</hi>, sets the final part (lines 73&#x2013;85) of a pastoral
        dialogue written by Guarini in 1579 to celebrate the wedding between Margherita and Duke Alfonso II d&#x2019;Este, <hi rend="italic">Dimmi, gentil
          pastore</hi> (but often printed under the name of Tasso in contemporary sources).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19"><p rend="footnote text"> See Angelo Solerti, <hi rend="italic">Le rime di Torquato Tasso, I: Bibliografia</hi> (Bologna:
            Romagnoli-Dall&#x2019;Acqua, 1898), 502&#x2013;503.</p></note> All this is well-known, at least since Chater&#x2019;s seminal article of 1978:<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn20" n="20"><p rend="footnote text"> See Chater, &#x201C;Fonti poetiche per i madrigali di Luca Marenzio,&#x201D; 78.</p></note>
        what seems to have gone unnoticed so far is that the final piece of our book, <hi rend="italic">Cantiam la bella Clori</hi>, is nothing but an
        adaptation from the immediately previous section of the same dialogue by Guarini (lines 60&#x2013;72). Once again, the name Clori is purposely
        inserted <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> in the text (here, instead of &#x201C;Dea&#x201D; and &#x201C;Reina&#x201D;).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn21" n="21"><p rend="footnote text"> See the relevant entry in &#x201C;The poetic texts: edition and critical report&#x201D; for a full comparison of the two
            texts.</p></note>
      </p>
        <p>As a result of this discovery, we have one more text by (in fact, adapted from) Guarini in Book VI <hi rend="italic">a 5</hi>, and more
        doubts about the identity of Clori and the meaning of the whole Tirsi &amp; Clori operation. Is this an old or a new piece? Did Marenzio set
        the excerpt from Guarini&#x2019;s dialogue back in 1579, for Margherita&#x2019;s wedding, and publish it, in a revised version, fifteen years later? Were
        the textual changes meant to severe the link with the 1579 event, and with Margherita, in order to make possible a reuse of the piece on a
        different occasion and for a different purpose? Then, why to reaffirm the original connection the following year, dedicating (or
        re-dedicating) the &#x2018;sequel&#x2019; piece <hi rend="italic">Lucida perla a cui fu conca il cielo</hi> to the initial dedicatee? Delicate issues of
        compositional chronology are at stake,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22" n="22"><p rend="footnote text"> In the introduction to her edition of
            Book VI <hi rend="italic">a 6</hi>, Patricia Myers suggested to date <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Lucida perla </hi>back to
            1579: see Luca Marenzio, <hi rend="italic">The Secular Works. 6: Il sesto libro de&#x2019; madrigali a sei voci (1595)</hi>, ed. by Patricia
            Myers (New York: The Broude Trust, 1983). Chater, in his review of the edition (<hi rend="italic">JAMS</hi> 38, no. 2 [1985], 376&#x2013;385),
            essentially accepted Myers&#x2019; view on this regard, but provided that one postulated substantial revisions by Marenzio before the 1595
            publication. In our case, given the full-sounding but straightforward chordal nature of <hi rend="italic">Cantiam la bella Clori</hi> and
            the fact that some relatively advanced details of the polychoral writing could easily be the fruit of a 1590s&#x2019; revision, it seems hard to
            draw definitive conclusions based on stylistic analysis.</p></note> and further research is needed to answer, or at least to reframe,
        these questions.</p>
        <p>Returning to Tirsi and Clori, and to their role within the structure of Book VI <hi rend="italic">a 5</hi>, Mauro Calcagno has recently
        proposed to read the entire book as a coherent narrative, with three alternating &#x2018;voices&#x2019; (Tirsi, Clori, and the Narrator) and four sections:
        the &#x201C;separation between the lovers&#x201D; (nos. 1&#x2013;9), is followed by a phase of &#x201C;rapprochement and intimacy&#x201D; (nos. 10&#x2013;13), then by &#x201C;death&#x201D; (nos.
        14&#x2013;15), and by the &#x201C;final attainment of love&#x201D; (nos. 16&#x2013;17).<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="23"><p rend="footnote text"> Mauro Calcagno,

        first &#x201C;section&#x201D;, for instance, are all written in low clefs (c1c3c4c4f4), but other, essentially musical, structuring principles are clearly
        at work (see Table 2).</p>
        <p>All the scholars who have studied this book, at least since Alfred Einstein, have underscored the stylistic shift from Marenzio&#x2019;s previous
          collections.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn24" n="24"><p rend="footnote text"> See the discussion and the literature quoted in Steven

        the book does not have a &#x201C;unified character&#x201D;, but is rather inspired by a &#x201C;subtly pluralistic aesthetic&#x201D;:<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p rend="footnote text"> Bizzarini, <hi rend="italic">Luca Marenzio</hi>, 294.</p></note> the touching monologues and laments on

        <p>Compared to some of the most famous books by Marenzio, such as the first and the last in the series <hi rend="italic">a 5</hi>, Book VI has
        apparently had a modest success:<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn29" n="29"><p rend="footnote text"> See Gargiulo, &#x201C;Quella &#x2018;melodia soavissima&#x2019;&#x201D;,

        madrigals issued by Kauffmann in Nuremberg (1601) and by the Phal&#xE8;se firm in Antwerp (1609 and 1632),<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn30" n="30"><p rend="footnote text"> See &#x201C;Description of the sources and consulted copies&#x201D;.</p></note> it has had otherwise no reprints in
        anthologies. Madrigal no. 13, <hi rend="italic">Mentre qual viva pietra</hi>, formed the basis for one of Girolamo Cavaglieri&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">contrafacta</hi><note place="foot" xml:id="ftn31" n="31"><p rend="footnote text"> In RISM 1616<hi rend="superscript">8</hi>:

          verified.</p></note> No. 3, <hi rend="italic">Donna de l&#x2019;alma mia, de la mia vita</hi>, was intabulated for the lute by Joachim van den Hove

        <p>On the other hand, Severo Bonini, in his <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Discorsi e regole </hi>(<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1653),
        singles out this book as an example of Marenzio&#x2019;s proficiency in what he calls &#x201C;terzo ordine&#x201D; and <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> corresponds
        to Monteverdi&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">seconda pratica</hi>.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p rend="footnote text"> See Gargiulo, &#x201C;Quella
            &#x2018;melodia soavissima&#x2019;&#x201D;, 282&#x2013;283. Gargiulo reads Bonini&#x2019;s passage as a reference to no. 1, <hi rend="italic">S&#x2019;io parto, i&#x2019; moro, e pur
              partir conviene</hi>, only, but in my opinion Bonini&#x2019;s phrasing refers to the whole book, identified through the opening piece, as it
            happens elsewhere in his text. </p></note> Furthermore, a systematic investigation about the texts set by Marenzio in Book VI <hi rend="italic">a 5</hi> and their concordances in other music collections indirectly attests to a favorable reception of the book: Marenzio
        was often the first to choose texts which later became popular among madrigalists (a clear example is no. 5, <hi rend="italic">Udite
          lagrimosi</hi>). </p>

        <p>The <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> of the book, issued by Angelo Gardano in Venice in 1594,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p rend="footnote text"> See &#x201C;Description of the sources and consulted copies&#x201D;.</p></note> is a remarkably accurate and correct edition, and
        the extant re-editions of 1603 and 1614 are also substantially reliable. The 1614 re-edition may derive directly from the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi>, based on the variants and on details of the mise-en-page and of &#x2018;calibration&#x2019;.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn38" n="38"><p rend="footnote text"> The 1614 print is in vertical format, while the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> is in oblong format: often, however,
            the content of the first two staves of the 1614 page exactly corresponds to that of the first staff in the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi>
            (in other cases, three staves of 1614 accommodate the content of two staves of the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi>). For the term
            &#x2018;calibration&#x2019; to indicate the operations of organizing the page layout and calculating the distribution of the music in the book, see

        Basso partbook: while the copy held at Modena, Biblioteca Estense Universitaria (I-MOe), has a misprint in the signature: &#x201C;Luca Marenzo&#x201D; (!),
        all the other consulted copies have the correct reading. The other case regards page 8 in the Tenore partbook (madrigal no. 8, <hi rend="italic">Ben ho del caro oggetto i sensi privi</hi>): in the copies held in Berkeley, Brussels, and London, the d3 at m. 16 is a <hi rend="italic">semiminima</hi> instead of a <hi rend="italic">minima</hi>; the other consulted copies have the correct reading. </p>
