        In collaboration with MODE, the Swiss ensemble La Pedrina has released a <a href="https://www.claves.ch/collections/rarities/products/luca-marenzio-il-pastor-fido" target="_blank">CD</a> devoted to Marenzio’s Pastor fido settings. They are presented not in the order in which they were published, but in the order in which they appear in the play, in an attempt to recompose the musical fragments of Guarini’s drama. La Pedrina performance also explores the supple declamatory and dramatic style of several of these madrigals by alternating solo interpretations with polyphonic realizations. The recordings are linked to the relevant madrigals in MODE.
