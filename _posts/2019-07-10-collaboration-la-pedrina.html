        The members of MODE collaborated with the ensemble "La Pedrina" founded by Francesco Perdini for the preparation of their recording of some madrigal of Marenzio. The selection of madrigals focused on those whose text was based on Guarini's Il Pastor Fido. With the support of the Swiss RISM Office, the director Francesco Saverio Pedrini and his ensemble La Pedrina chose to record a selection from this collection with the Claves label.
