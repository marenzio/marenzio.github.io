      <span class="head">A real <span style="font-style:italic">editio princeps</span>?</span>
    </h3>
    <p>In the same year of 1587 the two Venetian printers Giacomo Vincenzi and Riccardo Amadino produced two separate editions of Luca Marenzio&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:italic">Il quarto libro de&#x2019; madrigali a sei voci</span>. Despite the close time gap between the two prints, possibly only a few months, the title page of the Vincenzi edition claims the authority of the <span style="font-style:italic">editio princeps</span>, while the Amadino one prides itself on being a carefully corrected reedition.<span id="ftn1_return"><a class="notelink" title="The titlepages of the two prints are as follows: DI LUCA | MARENZIO | QUARTO LIBRO DE MADRIGALI | a Sei Voci Novamente composti, &amp; dati in luce. | CON&#x2026;" href="#ftn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> But is this really the case? Due to the small press run of 16<sup>th</sup>-century musical books, a reedition from the most successful collections could be produced two or three years after the original print, but one in the same calendar year is quite unusual. Why did this happen? A look into the circumstances of the publication sheds light on the special relationship between these two prints.</p>
    <p>In 1583, Vincenzi and Amadino had formed a printing partnership that had produced about twenty music books a year, among them two first editions of Marenzio&#x2019;s works (<span style="font-style:italic">Il primo libro delle villanelle a tre voci</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Il secondo libro delle canzonette alla napolitana a tre voci</span> in 1584&#x2013;5) and the reedition of the I a 5 from 1586.<span id="ftn2_return"><a class="notelink" title="On the two printers see Giacomo Baroncini and Luigi Collarile, &#x201C;Amadino, Ricciardo&#x201D; and &#x201C;Vincenti, Giacomo,&#x201D; in Dizionario degli editori musicali ital&#x2026;" href="#ftn2"><sup>2</sup></a></span> But already by mid-1586 the collaboration was dissolved, due to Vincenzi&#x2019;s marriage to the daughter of the printer Giorgio Angelieri. The commercial separation happened in a friendly way, as shown by the sharing of types and the joint issuing of a number of books on philosophy and religion in later years. It is quite likely that the privilege for the Marenzio edition was acquired together by Vincenzi and Amadino, who only later decided to issue two independent prints.<span id="ftn3_return"><a class="notelink" title="Christine Jeanneret, &#x201C; &#x201C;Dare in luce &amp; con diligenza correggere&#x201D;: A Study of Marenzio&#x2019;s Editions and Reeditions,&#x201D; in &#x201C;Compositor moderno e vago&#x201D;, 393." href="#ftn3"><sup>3</sup></a></span> Marenzio&#x2019;s IV a 6 was certainly one of the first items to be printed separately by the two publishers.</p>
    <p>This suggests that at some point Vincenzi and Amadino had a common text of the book, a <span style="font-style:italic">Stichvorlage</span>, from which both editions are derived. An analysis of the variants in both editions strongly confirms such a possibility. Both mistakes and corrections could have always been produced independently in the two prints. No significant errors link the two, thus demonstrating that they do not derive from each other, but from a common source. A crucial point of comparison is the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic">Dice la mia bellissima Licori</span> (n. 7), where the Vincenzi print has the ascending step g3&#x2013;a3 in the Canto, but the second note (a3) was clearly erased and reprinted over a previous c4. In the Amadino edition, the opening movement is g3&#x2013;d4, which reflects instead the original and correct version. The Vincenzi mistake is easily explainable: from an original g3&#x2013;d4, the second note was mistakenly lowered to a c4 during the composition of the printing forme, then corrected during proofreading to an a3 for contrapuntal reasons.<span id="ftn4_return"><a class="notelink" title="The c4 was against a f#3 in the Sesto voice, thus the correction to a3. On this variant see also Jeanneret, &#x201C;Dare in luce &amp; con diligenza correggere&#x201D;,&#x2026;" href="#ftn4"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>In this situation, it is problematic to define a clear and unique <span style="font-style:italic">editio princeps</span> of Marenzio&#x2019;s IV a 6. The Vincenzi print is the first chronologically, but Amadino&#x2019;s is certainly not a <span style="font-style:italic">codex descriptus</span>, a derivative source further removed from the original. Due to its direct filiation from a common source, the second print has a prominent role as well in establishing the text of the book. Ideally, this critical edition aims to reconstruct the common source, possibly a manuscripts by Marenzio&#x2019;s hand or by a copyist close to him, from which both editions were derived. Thus, this critical edition uses the Vincenzi print as its basis, but keeps into consideration the Amadino readings as well. For example, it reinstates the original leap g3&#x2013;d4 in the Canto of <span style="font-style:italic">Dice la mia bellissima Licori</span>, and follows better text underlays as preserved in the Amadino print.</p>

      <span class="head">Inside the Vincenzi workshop </span>
    </h3>
    <p>Of the Vincenzi edition, a number of copies are preserved: I-Bc (complete), GB-Ob (complete), D-Hs (CTBQS), I-Sd (ATBQS), I-Vnm (Q), US-BEm (C), F-Pn (B). Two other copies &#x2014; I-Bsp (complete) and F-A (TQ) &#x2014; could not be located at the time of this study.<span id="ftn5_return"><a class="notelink" title="Mentioned in Oscar Mischiati, Bibliografia delle opere dei musicisti bresciani pubblicate a stampa dal 1497 al 1740: opere di singoli autori; a cura d&#x2026;" href="#ftn5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> The seven available copies were consulted and collated. Their comparison offers an interesting glimpse into the printing process of the Vincenzi workshop.</p>
    <p>As the studies on 16<sup>th</sup> century music publishing have demonstrated, the typesetting for a new edition was normally done one printing forme at the time, each one of them including the pages on a recto or a verso of a paper sheet.<span id="ftn6_return"><a class="notelink" title="See for example Jane A. Bernstein, Print Culture and Music in Sixteenth Century Venice (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001) and Pugin, &#x201C;Music Print&#x2026;" href="#ftn6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> In the Vincenzi print of Marenzio&#x2019;s IV a 6, each printed sheet contains four pages on the recto and four on the verso, printed out of the same printing forme. Each forme was typeset and printed before being taken apart to reuse the types for the next one. In some cases, though, the printed sheet was proofread and corrected after some use, giving rise to the many differences found in multiple copies of the same edition.</p>
    <p>These differences &#x2014; the so-called stop-press corrections &#x2014; are quite evident in the surviving copies of the Vincenzi edition. As can be expected, they tend to concentrate into single moments of the printing, thus pointing towards a sporadic checking rather than a thorough proofreading. In the Alto and Tenore parts, for example, the corrections are limited to only one madrigal.<span id="ftn7_return"><a class="notelink" title="In the Alto there is only one correction in Questa ord&#xEC; il laccio, questa, whereas in the Tenore there are two in Tra l&#x2019;erbe a pi&#xE8; d&#x2019;un mirto, che &#x2019;l &#x2026;" href="#ftn7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> In the Basso, they appear in only two printing formes: that including the pages 3 and 6, and the one containing page 17. In the Canto, Quinto and Sesto, the corrections are a little more spread out, implying at least three or four stop-print moments. The Quinto, though, has five out of its six interventions concentrated in only two formes: the one containing the pages 1, 3 and 6, and the one with the pages 11 and 14. The corrections on page 14 could have likely been caused by a very evident &#x2018;leftover&#x2019; from a previous typesetting, an empty staff on the bottom of the page (an example of so-called &#x2018;standing types&#x2019;). Such a clear oversight could have draw attention to the sheet, stopped the print, and caused the intervention on page 11 as well. Besides the correction of the forme itself, some mistakes on already-printed pages were amended by erasing and reprinting the erroneous passage, or by pasting over a corrected cutout.</p>
    <p>Although not caused by the desire to improve the correctness of the final product, but by a misstep in the binding process, the most macroscopic difference among the Vincenzi copies needs to be mentioned. The exemplar preserved at Oxford, Bodleian Library (GB-Obl) contains, in place of the entire third gathering of the Canto (labeled C), the corresponding pages of the first book of madrigals for six voices by Francesco Farina. No other copy of this print survives, but the similarity of the fonts and decorated initials suggests that the book had been printed by Vincenzi as well, also around 1587.<span id="ftn8_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ian Fenlon, &#x201C;Farina, Francesco,&#x201D; in Oxford Music Online, accessed June 2014." href="#ftn8"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>If the Amadino 1587 reedition had already cast some shadow on the <span style="font-style:italic">editio princeps</span>, its authority is now further undermined by the lack of<span style="font-style:italic"> one</span> single text of it. None of the existing copies contains all the stop-print interventions, and thus none can be considered the final point of the correction process. A single moment of correction is not even preserved on the level of a given part-book. The copy of the Quinto preserved in the Marciana library, for example, presents an earlier, more incorrect version of the first sheet compared to the others, where in another it eliminates the standing types present in GB-Obl and D-Hs, thus providing a better one. The aim of this critical edition is to reconstruct a non-existent, ideal first edition through a critical selection of the correct readings present in the preserved copies. All the stop-press corrections &#x2013; with the exception of the ones that do not imply differences in the musical or poetic text, such an erroneous page number or the standing types mentioned above &#x2013; are discussed in the critical commentary.</p>

    <h3>
      <span class="head">Later reeditions </span>
    </h3>
    <p>The entire book was reprinted three times: by Gardano in 1593 and 1605 and by Scotto in 1603. Moreover, three other northern European prints including its contents, collections of more than one book of madrigals for six voices, were produced in Antwerp by Pierre Phal&#xE8;se and Jean Bell&#xE8;re in 1594, by Phal&#xE8;se alone in 1610, and in Nuremberg by Paul Kauffmann in 1608. Only the reeditions of the IV a 6 alone (Gardano and Scotto) have been considered in the present edition. </p>
    <p>The Gardano edition of 1593 derives from the Amadino 1587 print, although it is possible that the typographer had also a copy of the Vincenzi edition at hand and used it for the correction of some mistakes. The Gardano and Amadino prints share significant errors, for example the missing minima rest in the Canto of <span style="font-style:italic">N&#xE9; fero sdegno mai, Donna, mi mosse</span> (m. 53). The (occasional) collation with the Vincenzi text is evident in a pitch correction in the Quinto of <span style="font-style:italic">Oh, che soave e non inteso baccio</span> (m. 20), a contrapuntal mistake otherwise hard to catch without the help of a score. Another hint of the influence of the Vincenzi print on the Gardano 1593 text is the erroneous mensuraration sign 3/2 that appears in <span style="font-style:italic">Sonar le labra</span> (m. 94), not found in Amadino, but only in the F-Pn copy of the <span style="font-style:italic">princeps</span>. In the consulted copy of the Gardano print (Gb-Lcm) the sign 3/2 was later erased and corrected into C. This amendment, though, was clearly not carried on in all the other copies, as demonstrated by the duplication of the mistake in Scotto 1603. A similar situation obtains for the erroneous set of rests in <span style="font-style:italic">Non pu&#xF2;, Filli, pi&#xF9; il core</span> (Quinto, mm. 86&#x2013;9): corrected by erasing the superfluous ones at least in the Gb-Lcm copy of the Gardano print, it reappears in the two later reeditions.</p>
    <p>Such mistakes introduce the issue of filiation for the two prints by Scotto 1603 and Gardano 1605. Scotto 1603 is a clear <span style="font-style:italic">descriptus</span> of Gardano 1593, a quite inaccurate edition full of old and new mistakes. Despite being done &#x2018;in house&#x2019;, the relationship between Gardano 1593 and Gardano 1605 is not obvious. Although the filiation is evident, Gardano 1605 does not necessarily reproduces all the readings of the previous edition, but sometimes shares details &#x2013; especially in the poetic text &#x2013; with Scotto 1603. It is a better, cleaner edition compared to Scotto, with some clever and intuitive corrections.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, all the reeditions ultimately derive not from the Vincenzi, but the Amadino edition. Thus, in the printed tradition the &#x2018;second&#x2019; edition had a stronger influence then the <span style="font-style:italic">princeps</span>. In general, the two Gardano and the Scotto prints are <span style="font-style:italic">descripti</span>, and do not give any significant contribution to the reconstruction of the critical text.</p>

      <span class="head">A book in memory of Luigi d&#x2019;Este</span>
    </h3>
    <p>Marenzio&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:italic">Quarto libro de&#x2019; madrigali a sei voci</span> is dedicated to Jean de Vivonne, Marquis of Pisany and ambassador of the King of France to the Holy See. The letter, signed by the composer himself, is dated 10 December 1586, only a few days before the death of Cardinal Luigi d&#x2019;Este, Marenzio&#x2019;s employer since 1578.<span id="ftn9_return"><a class="notelink" title="Luigi d&#x2019;Este died in Rome in his palace of Montecavallo (now the Quirinale) on 31 December 1586. See Marco Bizzarini, Marenzio. La carriera di un musi&#x2026;" href="#ftn9"><sup>9</sup></a></span> The years in the service of Cardinal d&#x2019;Este had been the composer&#x2019;s most prolific, crucial in determining his poetic and stylistic choices, in particular the creation of a light-hearted type of madrigal, full of melodic invention and simple contrapuntal devices, which embodied the idyllic ideal and Arcadian pleasures of the Renaissance aristocracy.<span id="ftn10_return"><a class="notelink" title="Giuseppe Gerbino, Music and the Myth of Arcadia in Renaissance Italy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 292&#x2013;340." href="#ftn10"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>While Alfred Einstein had suggested that the dedication to Vivonne implied a search for a new employer, Marco Bizzarini&#x2019;s research has now satisfactory demonstrated that the publication of the IV a 6 had been planned (and possibly financed) by Este, who also chose the dedicatee.<span id="ftn11_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bizzarini, Marenzio, 132." href="#ftn11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> From 1573 on, Este had been the Cardinal Protector of the Kingdom of France, and thus in close relationship with the French ambassador.<span id="ftn12_return"><a class="notelink" title="Paolo Portoni, &#x201C;d&#x2019;Este, Luigi&#x201D; in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 43 (Rome: Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana, 1993). Online at www.tre&#x2026;" href="#ftn12"><sup>12</sup></a></span> In the two years before the publication of the book, the internal struggles between French Huguenots and Catholics had put strains on the relationship between Vivonne and the Pope, resulting in a temporary ban of the envoy from the Holy City. The delicate political situation was resolved with the help of Este, who in August 1586 welcomed the ambassador back in his delightful summer retreat at Villa d&#x2019;Este in Tivoli. Marenzio&#x2019;s dedication to Vivonne was likely conceived in the few months following this political triumph. Indeed, the letter explicitly mentions Vivonne&#x2019;s return to Italy as the occasion for the dedication.<span id="ftn13_return"><a class="notelink" title="Bizzarini, Marenzio, 125&#x2013;31." href="#ftn13"><sup>13</sup></a></span> Through him, Marenzio and his patron Luigi d&#x2019;Este were paying homage to the King of France and his reestablished relationship with the Holy See.</p>
    <p>Este&#x2019;s political <span style="font-style:italic">grandeur</span> was accompanied by an active love life. Lucrezia Bendidio was born in Ferrara in 1547, daughter of an aristocratic family with strict links to the court. In 1561 she went into the service of Luigi&#x2019;s sister, Leonora d&#x2019;Este, and the next year she was married off to Count Baldassarre Macchiavelli.<span id="ftn14_return"><a class="notelink" title="Remo Ceserani, &#x201C;Bendidio, Lucrezia,&#x201D; in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 8." href="#ftn14"><sup>14</sup></a></span> Her singing talent was appreciated at the Ferrarese court and celebrated in poems by Tasso, Ridolfo Arlotti and Giovanni Battista Pigna. Together with her sister Isabella, she sung for the court at least from 1571 to 1579.<span id="ftn15_return"><a class="notelink" title="Elio Durante, Anna Martellotti, Cronistoria del concerto delle dame principalissime di Margherita Gonzaga d&#x2019;Este (Florence: SPES, 1979), 14&#x2013;16." href="#ftn15"><sup>15</sup></a></span> Her amorous relationship with the Cardinal was in full bloom in the years 1571&#x2013;74, when she wrote passionate letters to her lover. On his side, Este was costantly kept informed of her behavior at the Estense court.<span id="ftn16_return"><a class="notelink" title="Ceserani, &#x201C;Bendidio, Lucrezia,&#x201D; and Luigi Cibrario, &#x201C;Degli amori e della prigionia di T.

Tasso [&#x2026;]&#x201D;, 68." href="#ftn17"><sup>17</sup></a></span></p>
    <p>At least four texts in Marenzio&#x2019;s IV a 6 can be linked to Lucrezia: Tasso&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:italic">Arsi gran tempo, e del mio foco indegno</span>, the two short madrigals by Giovanni Battista Pigna <span style="font-style:italic">La dipartita &#xE8; amara</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Vattene, anima mia, </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Non porta ghiaccio Aprile. </span>Tasso&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:italic">Arsi gran tempo, e del mio foco indegno</span> belongs to his poems dedicated to Lucrezia Bendidio, dated between 1561 and 1566, and first published in the <span style="font-style:italic">Rime de gli academici eterei</span> [Padova, 1567].<span id="ftn18_return"><a class="notelink" title="Torquato Tasso, Rime &#x2018;eteree&#x2019;, ed. Lanfranco Caretti (Parma: Zara, 1990), liv&#x2013;lvii." href="#ftn18"><sup>18</sup></a></span> Giovanni Battista Nicolucci, known as Pigna, worked at the Ferrarese court as secretary of Duke Alfonso II, and was the teacher of moral philosophy and astronomy to the young Luigi.<span id="ftn19_return"><a class="notelink" title="See Giovanni Battista Pigna, Il ben divino: inedito a cura di Neuro Bonifazi (Bologna: Commissione per i testi di lingua, 1965), ix and Portone, &#x201C;d&#x2019;Es&#x2026;" href="#ftn19"><sup>19</sup></a></span> The two madrigals by Pigna set by Marenzio are part of his <span style="font-style:italic">canzoniere</span>, collected by Guarini and dedicated to Leonora d&#x2019;Este, which celebrates the same Lucrezia Bendidio. Its titles, <span style="font-style:italic">Il ben divino</span> (The divine good, or The divine goodness) is a pun on the name of the lady (Bendidio = the good/goodness of God).</p>
    <p>Finally, the madrigal <span style="font-style:italic">Non porta ghiaccio Aprile </span>bears conflicting attributions to Annibale Pocaterra and Cesare Cremonini.<span id="ftn20_return"><a class="notelink" title="For the discussion of the attributions see the notes to the edition of the text." href="#ftn20"><sup>20</sup></a></span> Pocaterra was a courtier at Ferrara, born in 1559, whose poetry had been influenced by Tasso, Guarini and Pigna. According to Arnaldo Di Benedetto, some of his poems praise Bendidio under the pastoral name of Licori.<span id="ftn21_return"><a class="notelink" title="Arnaldo di Benedetto, &#x201C;Due canzonieri ferraresi dell&#x2019;et&#xE0; del Tasso,&#x201D; in Con e intorno a Torquato Tasso, (Naples: Liguori, 1996), 289." href="#ftn21"><sup>21</sup></a></span> If our text is by Pocaterra, the &#x201C;harsh Licori&#x201D; cited in the third verse could refer once more to Lucrezia.</p>
    <p>In a wider sense, the entire Book could be read as a restrospective narration of the amorous relationship between Lucrezia and the Cardinal. As in every <span style="font-style:italic">canzoniere</span>, the story of the lovers is recalled through different temporal and emotional phases. This includes a celebration of the couple (Gottifredi&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:italic">Tra l&#x2019;erbe a pi&#xE8; d&#x2019;un mirto, che &#x2019;l copriva</span>), a declaration of eternal fidelity (Tansillo&#x2019;s<span style="font-style:italic"> N&#xE9; fero sdegno mai, Donna, mi mosse</span>), and the sadness of separation (<span style="font-style:italic">La dipartita &#xE8; amara</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Caro Aminta, pur vuoi</span>), a feeling certanly evident since the Cardinal was residing largely in Rome from 1576 onwards. The more rationally-oriented side of the <span style="font-style:italic">canzoniere</span> contains a moral reflection on the ephemeral nature of love and beauty (Tasso&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:italic">Arsi gran tempo, e del mio foco indegno</span>), as well as clever arguments on the phenomenology of love (the opening madrigal <span style="font-style:italic">Se bramate ch&#x2019;io mora</span>, Guarini&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:italic">Dice la mia bellissima Licori</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Crudel, perch&#xE9; mi fuggi</span>, and Pigna&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:italic">Vattene, anima mia</span>). The exploration of eroticism touches also the possibility of Sapphic love, as sensually sung by Tasso in <span style="font-style:italic">Di nettare amoroso ebro la mente</span>. Given its position towards the end of the book, after madrigals recounting crisis and repentance, Pietro Barignano&#x2019;s <span style="font-style:italic">Vanneggio, od &#xE8; pur vero </span> could very well not represent the onset of love for Lucrezia, but rather its end and the opening to a <span style="font-style:italic">new</span> relationship. The closing piece of the book was certainly written by Marenzio as an external commission, i.e. as an <span style="font-style:italic">intermedio</span> for the comedy <span style="font-style:italic">Le stravaganze d&#x2019;amore</span> by Cristoforo Castelletti, performed during the Carnival of 1585 in the Roman palace of Giacomo Buoncompagni.<span id="ftn22_return"><a class="notelink" title="James Chater, &#x201C;Castelletti&#x2019;s &#x201C;Stravaganze d&#x2019;amore&#x201D; (1585): a Comedy with Interludes,&#x201D; Studi Musicali viii (1979), 85&#x2013;148." href="#ftn22"><sup>22</sup></a></span> Nevertheless, it fits the narrative of the book as a final statement on the nature of women and love.</p>
    <p>The madrigals of the IV a 6 were probably written at different times during the decade preceding their publication, and only later organized as a collection. Stylistically, they represent different choices and create a well-balanced mix of moods and techniques. Some are example of the light and graceful style so appreciated in the 1580s.<span id="ftn23_return"><a class="notelink" title="Chater, Luca Marenzio, 113&#x2013;127 and Gerbino, Music and the Myth of Arcadia, 323&#x2013;336. See for example Vanneggio, od &#xE8; pur vero." href="#ftn23"><sup>23</sup></a></span> Others, however, reflect a more sober writing, with denser contrapuntal textures and expressive dissonances.<span id="ftn24_return"><a class="notelink" title="For example in Arsi gran tempo, e del mio foco indegno." href="#ftn24"><sup>24</sup></a></span> The six voices allow a frequent use of double-choir writing, normally organized as Canto/Quinto/Alto against Tenore/Sesto/Basso (see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Tra l&#x2019;erbe a pi&#xE9; d&#x2019;un mirto</span>). The second madrigal of the book, <span style="font-style:italic">Di nettare amoroso ebro la mente</span>, is a Tasso sonnet on the topic on love as war with a lesbian twist. The fever of the battle is musically expressed by rapid syllabic repetition on semiminim and dotted rhythms, an early example of the <span style="font-style:italic">stile concitato</span> of the celebrated <span style="font-style:italic">Ottavo libro</span> by Claudio Monteverdi.<span id="ftn25_return"><a class="notelink" title="Repetitions at mm. 34&#x2013;49, dotted rhythms at 74&#x2013;9." href="#ftn25"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>

        <p>I am using the term &#x2018;reedition&#x2019; (instead of the most common &#x2018;reprint&#x2019;) to indicate a new typesetting of the music, and not a simple reuse of the printing formes, as suggested by Laurent Pugin.
