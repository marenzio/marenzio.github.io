    </h3>
    <p>The objectives of MODE concerning the presentation of the musical text of Marenzio&#x2019;s secular works are: a) to provide its users with a text derived from a systematic collation of the sources, including the surviving copies of the first edition, and b) to display the musical text in a form that facilitates the study and the performance of the music.</p>
    <p>This section lays out the editorial policy governing the interpretation and transcription of the music. The critical apparatus of individual books includes a discussion of specific editorial issues affecting specific points in the score (such as errors or conflicting variants).</p>

      </h4>
      <p>The original clefs have been substituted with modern ones (treble, transposed treble and bass clefs) to facilitate reading. At the beginning of each piece, incipits in original clefs show the use of either <span style="font-style:italic">chiavi naturali</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">chiavette</span>, as well as the original notation of the first few notes in each part.</p>

        <span class="headingNumber">1.2. </span>
        <span class="head">Mensurations and proportions</span>
      </h4>
      <p>Original mensuration signs and proportions have been maintained. Time signatures should be read as such and not as modern equivalents. All original note values have been retained. Most pieces are written with the mensuration sign C, implying a <span style="font-style:italic">tactus</span> of a semibreve. These pieces usually have shorter note values (ranging from the semibreve to the semifusa). Some madrigals are written in cut-C (or <span style="font-style:italic">alla breve</span>), normally implying a <span style="font-style:italic">tactus</span> of a breve with longer note-values (from the breve to the fusa), for example <span style="font-style:italic">Ahi dispietata morte</span> in the <span style="font-style:italic">Primo libro a quattro</span> (1585).</p>
      <p>Ternary sections requiring a <span style="font-style:italic">tactus inaequalis</span> are indicated by mensuration signs or proportions appearing in various forms. Proportion signs appearing in the course of a piece are maintained in the score and equivalences are suggested above.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Barring not present in the original partbooks has been added in the modern edition with respect to the original <span style="font-style:italic">tactus</span>. Decisions on barring have been made by the editors according not only to mensural signs but also to note values, rhythmic groupings, and the use of rests.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Blackened notes have been marked by half-brackets and resolved as triplets. Minor color (black semibrevis plus black minima) has been transcribed as a dotted half note followed by a quarter note; minor color at the level of brevis (black brevis plus black semibrevis) has been transcribed as a dotted whole note followed by a half note.</p>

      <p>Ligatures have been resolved with their respective note values. In the score, the notes originally ligated appear with the sign (&#x250D;&#x2511;). The most common ligature in</p>
      <p>Marenzio&#x2019;s time was the <span style="font-style:italic">cum opposita proprietate</span> type, this has been transcribed as two semibreves. In some rare cases the notes tied together in a ligature are blackened. Other types of ligatures are discussed in the critical apparatus.</p>

        <span class="head">Accidentals</span>
      </h4>
      <p>In line with sixteenth-century practice, accidentals apply only to adjacent notes. The edition inserts &#x201C;cautionary accidentals&#x201D; above the staff. They have been added either to resolve ambiguous passages or to make the alterations explicit that are only implied in the original notation, as typically occurs at cadences. Sharps or flats used as cancellation signs in the original notation have been rendered as natural signs without further mention in the critical notes.</p>

      <span class="headingNumber">2. </span>
      <span class="head">Text</span>
    </h3>
    <p>The goal of MODE concerning the presentation of the poetic text of Marenzio's secular works is to provide performers and scholars with a correct, accurate, and readable text. The editorial criteria aim to maintain many of their original features, but to adapt others to the rules of modern Italian, for example spelling, accents and apostrophes.</p>
    <p>The poetic text appearing in the critical apparatus is as close as possible to the one underlaid in the score</p>
    <p>These intervention have been done tacitly:</p>
    <p>1. The letters <span style="font-style:italic">v</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">u</span> are graphically differentiated by following modern spelling</p>
    <p>2. Only a single form of lowercase <span style="font-style:italic">s</span> is used.</p>
    <p>3. Abbreviations are written out in full.</p>
    <p>4. The ampersand and the Latinism <span style="font-style:italic">et</span> are written out as <span style="font-style:italic">e</span> before words beginning with a consonant or a vowel other than <span style="font-style:italic">e</span>. They are changed to <span style="font-style:italic">ed</span> before words beginning with <span style="font-style:italic">e</span>.</p>
    <p>5. Accents have been normalized according to modern usage. Phonic accents have been introduced in case of ambiguity of meaning (ex: v&#xF2;to)</p>
    <p>6. Apostrophes have been normalized according to modern usage. The apostrophe is introduced-- or kept, if present--in the presence of elision (ex.: ond&#x2019;egli), apocope (ex: co&#x2019;, di&#x2019;), or aphaeresis of the masculine definite article (ex.: &#x2019;l). In the original partbooks it is common to find the apostrophe to indicate synaloepha even in the absence of an elision; this has always been eliminated.</p>
    <p>7. Elisions: because the same word often appears differently among the original partbooks (with the final vowel elided or present), the version presented by the majority of the voices is adopted and extended to all the other voices. In cases in which the elided and non-elided forms are split among an equal number of partbooks, the non-elided version is adopted for all the voices. The elided vowel is reintroduced only when there is ambiguity in meaning, pronunciation, or punctuation. In these last cases, the reintroduced vowel appears in italics.</p>
    <p>8. Because the same word often appears differently among the partbooks as including either a single or a double consonant (geminates), the version presented by the majority of the voices is adopted and extended to all the other voices. In cases in which the two versions are split among an equal number of partbooks, the version adopted for all the voices is the one closest to modern usage.</p>
    <p>9. Capitalization conforms to modern usage. Capitals are maintained at the beginning of a line. Capitals are kept in the case of personifications (e. g., <span style="font-style:italic">Amor</span>).</p>
    <p>10. In the text under the notes, repeated words, lines, or syntagmas are separated by a comma, with the repeated segment starting with a lowercase letter even if it includes the beginning of a line (which is otherwise capitalized). Repeated segments that are not present as such in the underlaid text of the original partbooks appear in italics.</p>
    <p>11. Punctuation marks (periods, commas, colons, and semicolons, as well as question, exclamation and quotation marks) are introduced or modified according to modern usage.</p>
    <p>12. Both the etymological and the diacritical <span style="font-style:italic">h</span> have been eliminated (for example, <span style="font-style:italic">havr&#xE0; &gt; avr&#xE0;,</span> <span style="font-style:italic">ninphe </span> &gt; <span style="font-style:italic">ninfe, pharetra </span> &gt; <span style="font-style:italic">faretra, herba </span> &gt; <span style="font-style:italic">erba, boscho </span> &gt; <span style="font-style:italic">bosco</span>). In general, the use of<span style="font-style:italic">h </span>has<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>been modernized (<span style="font-style:italic">anc&#x2019;io</span> &gt; <span style="font-style:italic">anch&#x2019;io</span>). In the case of <span style="font-style:italic">o</span> used as interjection, it appears as <span style="font-style:italic">oh</span> (unlike in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">o</span> used as a vocative, such as in <span style="font-style:italic">O bellissima Licori</span>).</p>
    <p>13. The dental affricate <span style="font-style:italic">ti</span> has been changed to <span style="font-style:italic">zi</span>. (e.g.: Gratie &gt; Grazie)</p>
    <p>14. The <span style="font-style:italic">i</span> devoid of any diacritical function has been eliminated.</p>
    <p>15. Compound prepositions and adverbs appear in synthetic form (ex: ne i &gt; nei). However, the analytical form of the compound prepositions is adopted when the synthetic form would have caused doubling of the consonant or stress change (de le, a la, <span style="font-style:italic">poi che</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">ben che</span>). <span style="font-style:italic">Al'hor</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">all'hor </span>are changed to<span style="font-style:italic">allor</span>;<span style="font-style:italic">tal'hor </span>and<span style="font-style:italic">tal hor </span>to<span style="font-style:italic">talor</span>;<span style="font-style:italic">ogn'hor </span>to<span style="font-style:italic">ognor.</span></p>
    <p>16. Typos with no apparent meaning are included in the critical apparatus because they may provide information about the typographical genesis and filiation of the partbooks.</p>
