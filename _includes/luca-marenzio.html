            During the second half of the sixteenth century, Luca Marenzio was the first musician whose works were published during his lifetime as an opera omnia. His output had a fundamental impact on early modern European culture in general. This also has to do with the wide dissemination of his music and the poems that he set. During his life, spent mostly in Rome, Marenzio composed music for some of the most powerful and culturally advanced courts in Italy. In 1578 he entered the service of Cardinal Luigi d’Este, under whose patronage he began to publish an impressive number of madrigal books. He soon emerged as the most popular madrigal composer of the time, significantly changing the history of the genre (in his landmark 1949 monograph The Italian Madrigal, Alfred Einstein called Marenzio “the true Mozart of the madrigal”). After Luigi d’Este’s death, Marenzio was recruited by the Medici family in Florence, and, after a brief period of time spent in Poland, he returned to Rome under the protection of the Montalto and Aldobrandini families. By 1599, the year of his death, he had published eighteen volumes of madrigals and five books of villanelle (or canzonette, short, light songs for three voices).

            The first editions of Marenzio’s music were published either in Venice or in Rome, whereas the reprints—seventy, a record number for the time and a clear sign of success—were issued also in Antwerp, Nuremberg, and Paris. Printed and reprinted dozens of times during his lifetime and beyond, Marenzio’s published output presents the perfect example of the power of the printed book to project not only a composer’s reputation--and that of his patrons--but also the values of the society he represented, far beyond the confines of his immediate circle of patronage. Many of Marenzio’s works were also published separately in madrigal collections with the texts translated or paraphrased into Latin, German, and English.

            The composer’s poetic choices embraced the entire breadth and depth of the Italian lyric tradition, from the light-hearted spirit of popular genres to the gravity of Dante and Petrarch, from the most experimental poetry of the late Renaissance to the sensuousness of Tasso and Guarini. Entire generations of readers, not only in Italy but throughout Europe, encountered the literary imagery and cultural values of this poetry as much through Marenzio’s musical voice as through any private reading of the texts themselves. Marenzio’s secular music represents one of the most fascinating journeys into Renaissance interiority.
